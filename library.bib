However, this allows for ambiguities and uncertainties which have an impact on finite nuclei, nuclear- and neutron-matter properties. On the other hand the nuclear many body problem is intrinsically difficult and the computational cost increases with numerical precision and number of nucleons. However, it is unclear what the physical precision should be for these calculations. In this contribution we review much of the work done in Granada to encompass both the uncertainties stemming from the NN scattering database in light nuclei such as triton and alpha particle and the numerical precision required by the solution method.},

This reproduction of the [Formula Presented] data is more accurate than by any phase-shift analysis and any other [Formula Presented] potential. This is achieved by the introduction of two effective [Formula Presented] mesons the parameters of which are partial-wave dependent. The charge dependence of the present potential (which we call “CD-Bonn”) is based upon the predictions by the Bonn full model for charge symmetry and charge-independence breaking in all partial waves with [Formula Presented] The potential is represented in terms of the covariant Feynman amplitudes for one-boson exchange which are nonlocal. Therefore, the off-shell behavior of the CD-Bonn potential differs in a characteristic way from commonly used local potentials and leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few- and many-body systems, where underbinding is a persistent problem. {\textcopyright} 2001 The American Physical Society.},

The result obtained in a 34-channel, charge-dependent Faddeev calculation is 8.00 MeV, which is 0.4 MeV above the predictions by local NN potentials.

However, NN interactions are subjected to statistical and systematic uncertainties, which are expected to propagate and have some impact on the predictive power and accuracy of theoretical calculations, regardless on the numerical accuracy of the method used to solve the many body problem. We stress the necessary conditions required for a correct and self-consistent statistical interpretation of the discrepancies between theory and experiment which enable a subsequent statistical error propagation and correlation analysis. We comprehensively discuss a stringent and recently proposed tail-sensitive normality test and provide a simple recipe to implement it. As an application, we analyze the deduced uncertainties and correlations of effective interactions in terms of Moshinsky-Skyrme parameters and effective field theory counterterms as derived from the bare NN potential containing one-pion-exchange and chiral two-pion-exchange interactions inferred from scattering data.},

abstract = {We introduce new semilocal two-nucleon potentials up to fifth order in the chiral expansion. We employ a simple regularization approach for the pion exchange contributions which i) maintains the long-range part of the interaction, ii) is implemented in momentum space and iii) can be straightforwardly applied to regularize many-body forces and current operators. We discuss in detail the two-nucleon contact interactions at fourth order and demonstrate that three terms out of fifteen used in previous calculations can be eliminated via suitably chosen unitary transformations. The removal of the redundant contact terms results in a drastic simplification of the fits to scattering data and leads to interactions which are much softer (i.e., more perturbative) than our recent semilocal coordinate-space regularized potentials. Using the pion-nucleon low-energy constants from matching pion-nucleon Roy-Steiner equations to chiral perturbation theory, we perform a comprehensive analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering and the deuteron properties up to fifth chiral order and study the impact of the leading F-wave two-nucleon contact interactions which appear at sixth order. The resulting chiral potentials at fifth order lead to an outstanding description of the proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering data from the self-consistent Granada-2013 database below the pion production threshold, which is significantly better than for any other chiral potential. For the first time, the chiral potentials match in precision and even outperform the available high-precision phenomenological potentials, while the number of adjustable parameters is, at the same time, reduced by about ∼ 40 {\%} {\%}. Last but not least, we perform a detailed error analysis and, in particular, quantify for the first time the statistical uncertainties of the fourth- and the considered sixth-order contact interactions.},

abstract = {High-precision cross-section data of the deuteron-proton breakup reaction at 130 MeV are presented for 72 kinematically complete configurations. The data cover a large region of the available phase space, divided into a systematic grid of kinematical variables. They are compared with theoretical predictions, in which the full dynamics of the three-nucleon (3N) system is obtained in three different ways: realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials are combined with model 3N forces (3NF's) or with an effective 3NF resulting from explicit treatment of the {\^{I}}"-isobar excitation. Alternatively, the chiral perturbation theory approach is used at the next-to-next-to-leading order with all relevant NN and 3N contributions taken into account. The generated dynamics is then applied to calculate cross-section values by rigorous solution of the 3N Faddeev equations. The comparison of the calculated cross sections with the experimental data shows a clear preference for the predictions in which the 3NF's are included. The majority of the experimental data points are well reproduced by the theoretical predictions. The remaining discrepancies are investigated by inspecting cross sections integrated over certain kinematical variables. The procedure of global comparisons leads to establishing regularities in disagreements between the experimental data and the theoretically predicted values of the cross sections. They indicate deficiencies still present in the assumed models of the 3N system dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

The experiment uses a shielded neutron source which produced polarized neutrons via the 2H(d - ,n - )3He reaction. It also uses a deuterated liquid-scintillator center detector and six pairs of liquid-scintillator neutron side detectors. Elastic neutron scattering events are identified by using time-of-flight techniques and by setting a window in the center detector pulse-height spectrum. The beam polarization is monitored by using a high-pressure helium gas cell and an additional pair of liquid-scintillator side detectors. The n-d Ay($\theta$) data were corrected for finite-geometry and multiple-scattering effects using a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment. The 22.5-MeV data demonstrate that the three-nucleon analyzing power puzzle also exists at this energy. They show a significant discrepancy with predictions of high-precision nucleon-nucleon potentials alone or combined with Tucscon-Melbourne or Urbana IX three-nucleon forces, as well as currently available effective-field theory based potentials of next-to-next-to-next-to- leading order. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

They are compared with results of three-nucleon Faddeev calculations based on the standard, high-precision nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials alone or combined with commonly used three-nucleon force (3NF) models such as the Tucson-Melbourne '99 or the Urbana IX. Predicted 3NF effects localized at backward angles are supported only partially by the data. The data are also compared to predictions based on locally regularized chiral NN potentials. An estimation of theoretical truncation uncertainties in the consecutive orders of chiral expansion suggests that the observed discrepancies between this modern theory and the data could probably be explained by including chiral 3NF's in future calculations. A systematic comparison to the deuteron analyzing power data previously taken at incident energies from 70 to 294 MeV/nucleon clearly shows that not only the cross section but also the analyzing powers reveal growing 3NF effects when the three-nucleon system energy is increased.},

The obtained uncertainties of the differential cross section and numerous scattering observables are in general small, grow with the reaction energy, and amount up to a few percent at 200 MeV. We compare these uncertainties with the other types of theoretical errors like truncation errors, numerical uncertainties, and uncertainties arising from using the various models of nuclear interaction. We find the latter ones to be dominant source of uncertainties of modern predictions for the three-nucleon scattering observables. To perform above mentioned studies we use the One-Pion-Exchange Gaussian potential derived by the Granada group, for which the covariance matrix of its parameters is known, and solve the Faddeev equation for the nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering. Thus besides studying theoretical uncertainties we also show a description of the nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering data by the One-Pion-Exchange Gaussian model and compare it with results obtained with other nucleon-nucleon potentials, including chiral N4LO forces from the Bochum-Bonn and Moscow(Idaho)-Salamanca groups. In this way we confirm the usefulness and high quality of the One-Pion-Exchange Gaussian force.},

abstract = {We present NN potentials through five orders of chiral effective field theory ranging from leading order (LO) to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N4LO). The construction may be perceived as consistent in the sense that the same power counting scheme as well as the same cutoff procedures are applied in all orders. Moreover, the long-range parts of these potentials are fixed by the very accurate $\pi$N low-energy constants (LECs) as determined in the Roy-Steiner equations analysis by Hoferichter, Ruiz de Elvira, and coworkers. In fact, the uncertainties of these LECs are so small that a variation within the errors leads to effects that are essentially negligible, reducing the error budget of predictions considerably. The NN potentials are fit to the world NN data below the pion-production threshold of the year 2016. The potential of the highest order (N4LO) reproduces the world NN data with the outstanding $\chi$2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever accomplished for any chiral NN potential to date. The NN potentials presented may serve as a solid basis for systematic ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions that allow for a comprehensive error analysis. In particular, the consistent order by order development of the potentials will make possible a reliable determination of the truncation error at each order. Our family of potentials is nonlocal and, generally, of soft character. This feature is reflected in the fact that the predictions for the triton binding energy (from two-body forces only) converges to about 8.1 MeV at the highest orders. This leaves room for three-nucleon-force contributions of moderate size.},

We are able to significantly reduce finite-cutoff artefacts by using an appropriate regularization in coordinate space which maintains the analytic structure of the amplitude. The new potentials do not require the additional spectral function regularization employed in (Nucl. Phys.

We discuss in detail the construction of the new potentials and convergence of the chiral expansion for two-nucleon observables. We also employ a simple approach for estimating the theoretical uncertainty in few-nucleon calculations from the truncation of the chiral expansion that replaces previous reliance on cutoff variation.},

We find a substantial improvement in the description of nucleon-nucleon phase shifts as compared to the fourth-order results utilizing a coordinate-space regularization. This provides clear evidence of the corresponding two-pion exchange contributions with all low-energy constants being determined from pion-nucleon scattering. The fifth-order corrections to nucleon-nucleon observables appear to be of a natural size, which confirms the good convergence of the chiral expansion for nuclear forces. Furthermore, the obtained results provide strong support for the novel way of quantifying the theoretical uncertainty due to the truncation of the chiral expansion proposed by the authors.

abstract = {During the past two decades, chiral effective field theory has become a popular tool to derive nuclear forces from first principles. Two-nucleon interactions have been worked out up to sixth order of chiral perturbation theory and three-nucleon forces up to fifth order. Applications of some of these forces have been conducted in nuclear few- and many-body systems - with a certain degree of success. But in spite of these achievements, we are still faced with great challenges. Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty quantification of predictions obtained when applying these forces in ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is the order by order convergence of the chiral expansion. We start this review with a pedagogical introduction and then present the current status of the field of chiral nuclear forces. This is followed by a discussion of representative examples for the application of chiral two- and three-body forces in the nuclear many-body system including convergence issues.},

abstract = {We present N N potentials through five orders of chiral effective field theory ranging from leading order (LO) to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N4LO). The construction may be perceived as consistent in the sense that the same power counting scheme as well as the same cutoff procedures are applied in all orders. Moreover, the long-range parts of these potentials are fixed by the very accurate $\pi$N low-energy constants (LECs) as determined in the Roy-Steiner equations analysis by Hoferichter, Ruiz de Elvira and coworkers. In fact, the uncertainties of these LECs are so small that a variation within the errors leads to effects that are essentially negligible, reducing the error budget of predictions considerably. The N N potentials are fit to the world N N data below pion-production threshold of the year of 2016. The potential of the highest order (N4LO) reproduces the world N N data with the outstanding $\chi$ 2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever accomplished for any chiral N N potential to date. The N N potentials presented may serve as a solid basis for systematic ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions that allow for a comprehensive error analysis. In particular, the consistent order by order development of the potentials will make possible a reliable determination of the truncation error at each order. Our family of potentials is non-local and, generally, of soft character. This feature is reflected in the fact that the predictions for the triton binding energy (from two-body forces only) converges to about 8.1 MeV at the highest orders. This leaves room for three-nucleon-force contributions of moderate size.},

abstract = {A multienergy phase shift analysis of all published proton-proton (pp) scattering data in the energy range Tlab30 MeV is presented. In the description of all partial waves the well-known long-range interaction is included: the improved Coulomb, the vacuum polarization, and the one-pion-exchange potential. In the lower partial waves the energy-dependent analysis uses a P-matrix parametrization for the short-range interaction. Special attention is paid to the electric interaction, the definition of the phase shifts, and the selection of the data. The fit to the final data set comprising 360 scattering observables results in 2/Ndf=1.0, where Ndf is the number of degrees of freedom. The pp0 coupling constant is determined to be gpp20/414.5+1.2, but there are several indications for a lower value. The optimum value for the P-matrix radius bs1.4 fm is satisfying. Single-energy phase shifts with second derivative matrices, and effective range parameters are given. {\textcopyright} 1988 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Using the covariant spectator theory (CST), we present two one-boson-exchange kernels that have been successfully adjusted to fit the 2007 world np data (containing 3788 data) below 350 MeV. One model (which we designate WJC-1) has 27 parameters and fits with a $\chi$2/Ndata=1.06. The other model (designated WJC-2) has only 15 parameters and fits with a $\chi$2/Ndata=1.12. Both of these models also reproduce the experimental triton binding energy without introducing additional irreducible three-nucleon forces. One result of this work is a new phase-shift analysis, updated for all data until 2006, which is useful even if one does not work within the CST. In carrying out these fits we have reviewed the entire database, adding new data not previously used in other high precision fits and restoring some data omitted in previous fits. A full discussion and evaluation of the 2007 database is presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Furnstahl2015,
abstract = {Bayesian procedures designed to quantify truncation errors in perturbative calculations of quantum chromodynamics observables are adapted to expansions in effective field theory (EFT). In the Bayesian approach, such truncation errors are derived from degree-of-belief (DOB) intervals for EFT predictions. Computation of these intervals requires specification of prior probability distributions ("priors") for the expansion coefficients. By encoding expectations about the naturalness of these coefficients, this framework provides a statistical interpretation of the standard EFT procedure where truncation errors are estimated using the order-by-order convergence of the expansion. It also permits exploration of the ways in which such error bars are, and are not, sensitive to assumptions about EFT-coefficient naturalness. We first demonstrate the calculation of Bayesian probability distributions for the EFT truncation error in some representative examples and then focus on the application of chiral EFT to neutron-proton scattering. Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei{\ss}ner recently articulated explicit rules for estimating truncation errors in such EFT calculations of few-nucleon-system properties. We find that their basic procedure emerges generically from one class of naturalness priors considered and that all such priors result in consistent quantitative predictions for 68{\%} DOB intervals. We then explore several methods by which the convergence properties of the EFT for a set of observables may be used to check the statistical consistency of the EFT expansion parameter.},

abstract = "The values of the polarization in neutron-proton scattering have been measured in eleven energy bands between 20 and 120 MeV in the angular range 20° to 160° c.m., using time-of-flight techniques. The accuracy of the measurement is greatest, typically 2 to 3%, in the middle of the energy range where little other data are available. There is fairly good agreement between experiment and the YLAN4M phase shift analysis predictions in the general angle and energy dependence of the polarization values. Attention is drawn to the fact that some discrepancies exist which exceed the combined experimental and phase shift prediction errors."
