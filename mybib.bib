  abstract = {We investigate the behaviour of the nuclear forces as a function of the light quark masses (or, equivalently, pion mass) in the framework of chiral effective field theory at next-to-leading order. The nucleon–nucleon force is described in terms of one and two-pion exchange and local short distance operators, which depend explicitly and implicitly on the quark masses. The pion propagator becomes Coulomb-like in the chiral limit and thus one has significant scattering in all partial waves. The pion–nucleon coupling depends implicitly on the quark masses and we find that it becomes stronger in the chiral limit. There is a further quark mass dependence in the S-wave four-nucleon couplings, which can be estimated by means of dimensional analysis. We find that nuclear physics in the chiral limit becomes natural. There are no new bound states, the deuteron binding energy is BDCL=9.6±1.9+1.8−1.0 MeV, and the S-wave scattering lengths take values of a few fm, aCL(1S0)=−4.1±1.6+0.0−0.4 fm and aCL(3S1)=1.5±0.4+0.2−0.3 fm. We also discuss the extrapolation to larger pion masses pertinent for the extraction of these quantities from lattice simulations.}

The form factor of 3He shows sensitivity to the change in the wave-function induced by the three-nucleon force. The secondary maximum increases as a whole, and the radius comes closer to the experimental value; however the notorious discrepancy in the first minimum increases, too.}

  abstract = {The modern status of basic low energy QCD parameters is reviewed. It is demonstrated that the recent data allow one to determine the light quark mass ratios with an accuracy of 10â€“15%. The general analysis of vacuum condensates in QCD is presented, including those induced by external fields. The QCD coupling constant Î±s(mÏ„2) is found from the Ï„-lepton hadronic decay rate. The contour improved perturbation theory includes the terms up to Î±s4. The influence of instantons on Î±s(mÏ„2) determination is estimated. Vâˆ’A spectral functions of the Ï„-decay are used for construction of the Vâˆ’A polarization operator Î Vâˆ’A(s) in the complex s-plane. The operator product expansion (OPE) is used up to dimension D=10 and the sum rules along the rays in the complex s-plane are constructed. This makes it possible to separate the contributions of operators of different dimensions. The best values of the quark condensate and Î±sã€ˆ0|qÌ„q|0ã€‰2 are found. The value of the quark condensate is confirmed by considering the sum rules for baryon masses. The value of the gluon condensate is found in four ways: by considering the V+A polarization operator based on the Ï„-decay data and by studying the sum rules for polarization operator momenta in charmonia in the vector, pseudoscalar and axial channels. All of these determinations are in agreement and result in ã€ˆ(Î±s/Ï€)G2ã€‰=0.005Â±0.004GeV4. Valence quark distributions in the proton are calculated in QCD using the OPE in the proton current virtuality. The quark distributions agree with those found from the deep inelastic scattering data. The same value of the gluon condensate is favoured.}

abstract = {Components T20, T22 tensor and T11 vector analyzing power of the d(e, pn)e' rection with an electron scattered at a small angle (deuteron photodisintegration) were measured. The measurements were performed for photon energy in the range 40–550 MeV and with the center-of-mass angle of the outgoing proton being 88°. Only qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions for T22 and T20 has been observed.}

The inverse process, the photodisintegration of the deuteron, was measured in the same energy range by different authors with contradictory results, some of them in large disagreement with all theoretical predictions of the cross section. The submitted data are in agreement with theory and the results of a recent total absorption experiment.}

At eight angles between 18° and 145° charged particles were detected simultaneously in time-of-flight spectrometers consisting of scintillation counters. Above the resonance region the measured cross sections agree fairly well with earlier results, whereas there are larger discrepancies at low photon energies.}
