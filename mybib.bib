  abstract = {We investigate the behaviour of the nuclear forces as a function of the light quark masses (or, equivalently, pion mass) in the framework of chiral effective field theory at next-to-leading order. The nucleon–nucleon force is described in terms of one and two-pion exchange and local short distance operators, which depend explicitly and implicitly on the quark masses. The pion propagator becomes Coulomb-like in the chiral limit and thus one has significant scattering in all partial waves. The pion–nucleon coupling depends implicitly on the quark masses and we find that it becomes stronger in the chiral limit. There is a further quark mass dependence in the S-wave four-nucleon couplings, which can be estimated by means of dimensional analysis. We find that nuclear physics in the chiral limit becomes natural. There are no new bound states, the deuteron binding energy is BDCL=9.6±1.9+1.8−1.0 MeV, and the S-wave scattering lengths take values of a few fm, aCL(1S0)=−4.1±1.6+0.0−0.4 fm and aCL(3S1)=1.5±0.4+0.2−0.3 fm. We also discuss the extrapolation to larger pion masses pertinent for the extraction of these quantities from lattice simulations.}

The secondary maximum increases as a whole, and the radius comes closer to the experimental value; however the notorious discrepancy in the first minimum increases, too.}

  abstract = {The modern status of basic low energy QCD parameters is reviewed. It is demonstrated that the recent data allow one to determine the light quark mass ratios with an accuracy of 10â€“15%. The general analysis of vacuum condensates in QCD is presented, including those induced by external fields. The QCD coupling constant Î±s(mÏ„2) is found from the Ï„-lepton hadronic decay rate. The contour improved perturbation theory includes the terms up to Î±s4. The influence of instantons on Î±s(mÏ„2) determination is estimated. Vâˆ’A spectral functions of the Ï„-decay are used for construction of the Vâˆ’A polarization operator Î Vâˆ’A(s) in the complex s-plane. The operator product expansion (OPE) is used up to dimension D=10 and the sum rules along the rays in the complex s-plane are constructed. This makes it possible to separate the contributions of operators of different dimensions. The best values of the quark condensate and Î±sã€ˆ0|qÌ„q|0ã€‰2 are found. The value of the quark condensate is confirmed by considering the sum rules for baryon masses. The value of the gluon condensate is found in four ways: by considering the V+A polarization operator based on the Ï„-decay data and by studying the sum rules for polarization operator momenta in charmonia in the vector, pseudoscalar and axial channels. All of these determinations are in agreement and result in ã€ˆ(Î±s/Ï€)G2ã€‰=0.005Â±0.004GeV4. Valence quark distributions in the proton are calculated in QCD using the OPE in the proton current virtuality. The quark distributions agree with those found from the deep inelastic scattering data. The same value of the gluon condensate is favoured.}

  abstract = {We derive the complete three-nucleon potential of the two-pion-exchange type, suitable for nuclear structure calculations, by extending away from the forward direction the subthreshold off-pion-mass-shell πN scattering amplitude of Coon, Scadron and Barrett. The off-mass-shell extrapolation, subject to current algebra and PCAC constraints, yields approximately model independent amplitudes (in that they depend primarily on πN data) in the complete potential. The subtraction of the forward propagating nucleon term from the amplitudes is done in greater generality than before. The contribution of this three-nucleon potential to the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter is estimated using the perturbative formalism of McKellar and Rajaraman. In our treatment of correlations in nuclear matter, the dominant three-nucleon potential has strong components from both s-wave and p-wave πN scattering. A three-body potential based on the p-wave Δ isobar can be considered a special case of the derived potential. Therefore, we are able to trace most of the discrepancies in previously reported binding energy contributions back to the assumed energy denominator in second order. We find the contribution of the three nucleon potential to the energy of symmetric nuclear matter to be − 1.90 ± 0.2 MeV.}

abstract = {We discuss the application of the chiral N3LO forces to three-nucleon reactions and point to the challenges which will have to be addressed. Present approaches to solve three-nucleon Faddeev equations are based on a partial-wave decomposition. A rapid increase of the number of terms contributing to the chiral three-nucleon force when increasing the order of the chiral expansion from N2LO to N3LO forced us to develop a fast and effective method of automatized partial-wave decomposition. At low energies of the incoming nucleon below ≈20 MeV, where only a limited number of partial waves is required, this method allowed us to perform calculations of reactions in the three-nucleon continuum using N3LO two- and three-nucleon forces. It turns out that inclusion of consistent chiral interactions, with relativistic 1/m corrections and short-range 2π-contact term omitted in the N3LO three-nucleon force, does not explain the long standing low energy Ay-puzzle. We discuss problems arising when chiral forces are applied at higher energies, where large three-nucleon force effects are expected. It seems plausible that at higher energies, due to a rapid increase of a number of partial waves required to reach convergent results, a three-dimensional formulation of the Faddeev equations which avoids partial-wave decomposition is desirable.}

abstract = {Elastic electromagnetic nucleon form factors have long provided vital information about the structure and composition of these most basic elements of nuclear physics. The form factors are a measurable and physical manifestation of the nature of the nucleons' constituents and the dynamics that binds them together. Accurate form factor data obtained in recent years using modern experimental facilities has spurred a significant reevaluation of the nucleon and pictures of its structure; e.g., the role of quark orbital angular momentum, the scale at which perturbative QCD effects should become evident, the strangeness content, and meson-cloud effects. We provide a succinct survey of the experimental studies and theoretical interpretation of nucleon electromagnetic form factors.}

abstract = {Detailed information on the inner structure of the nucleon is provided by accurate data on the dependence of the nucleon form factors on momentum transfer q2. Such data serve as a sensitive test for models of the nucleon. Particularly at low q2 accurate data on the form factors are also needed for calculations of nuclear form factors. Whereas the proton form factors are known with excellent precision over a large range of q2, data for the neutron are of much poorer quality due to the lack of a free neutron target. This is true for both the electric form factor, Gen, and to a somewhat lesser degree for the magnetic one, Gmn. With today's high duty factor, high current electron beam facilities like JLAB and MAMI, and the progress made in polarized beam and target technology, significant progress in this area is being made.}

journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {We investigate the impact of statistical uncertainties in the two-nucleon potentials on the neutron–deuteron elastic scattering and the deuteron breakup reaction observables at incoming nucleon kinetic energy up to 200 MeV. To that end we use the semi-phenomenological one-pion-exchange- Gaussian two-nucleon potential developed by the Granada group and the recent semi-local momentum-space regularized chiral nucleon–nucleon interaction at various orders, neglecting the three-nucleon force present in the three-nucleon system. The magnitudes of statistical uncertainties for these two potentials are found to be rather similar. For the chiral potential, we also show truncation errors estimated, among others, using the Bayesian method and discuss the residual cutoff dependence. The statistical uncertainty is generally found to be smaller than the truncation errors except for certain observables calculated at high chiral orders at nucleon energies up to 65 MeV. In general, magnitudes of the theoretical uncertainties are small and amount up to 0.5%–4%, depending on the observable and energy.}

  abstract = {After a brief historic overview the basic equations for three-nucleon (3N) scattering based on general two-nucleon and 3N forces are reviewed and the main steps for their derivation are given. Also the expressions for the various observables, elastic and breakup cross sections, as well as the great variety of spin observables are displayed and derived. The treatment of the 3N Faddeev equations in momentum space and in a partial wave decomposition is outlaid in some detail, the handling of the singularities in the integral kernel described and the algorithms and techniques used to solve the large set of equations in the discretized form are presented. Accuracy tests in form of benchmark calculations, where our results are compared to the ones of other techniques, are given. The bulk part of this review, however, is devoted to the comparison of very many observables in elastic nucleon-deuteron (Nd) scattering and the breakup process to the predictions based on the most modern nucleon-nucleon (NN) forces AV18, Nijmegen93, Nijmegen I and II and a recently updated OBE-potential CD Bonn. Overall the agreement with the data is excellent and there is little room left for the action of a three-nucleon force (3NF). The effects of the π-π, π-ϱ and ϱ-ϱ exchange 3NF's of the Tucson-Melbourne model are studied. They are in general small and in the few cases where discrepancies to data occur using NN forces only, they go into the wrong direction. We propose quite a few measurements, which should help to get more information on the potential energy of three nucleons. Several special topics are discussed: Do certain 3N scattering observables scale with the triton binding energy? Which of the 3N breakup cross sections are totally insensitive to the choice of the NN force and which are very sensitive? How well can one extract the nn scattering length from the 3N breakup? We discuss the outsticking discrepancy of the 3N analyzing power Ay in low energy elastic Nd scattering; the eigen phase shifts and mixing parameters in elastic nd scattering; the simplifications of 3N scattering at high energies and the formulation of the optical potential for elastic nd scattering and its limiting form at high energies. Alternative approaches to solve 3N scattering: in configuration space, using finite rank expansions of NN forces, variational techniques and the hybrid Sendai method are briefly described as well as the proton proton Coulomb force problem in the pd system and the question how to incorporate relativity. Finally some applications are sketched where a 3N final state occurs and where the interaction among the nucleons requires a correct treatment. We mention inelastic electron scattering as well as π-absorption on 3He (3H) and nonmesonic decay of the hypertriton.}

Therefore GnE can be measured reliably at large momentum transfer. While the proton form factor is dominated by the Dirac-, the neutron form factor in contrast is dominated by the Pauli contribution. Therefore high-momentum measurements can separate both effects. In view of the importance of the nucleon form factors for the underlying strong interaction theory additional precise measurements in the region of momentum transfer: 1 GeV2 < Q2 < 10 GeV2, are of the greatest importance.}
