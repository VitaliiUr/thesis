\subsection*{Why we study few nucleon systems}

The study of light nuclei and their reactions for the decades has been serving as an easiest way
to investigate NN systems and forces inside the atoms. 
Convenient way to proceed may be an interaction of nucleus with
other nucleus, particles or electromagnetic probes in elastic or inelastic scattering.
It is possible to perform such an experiments and check if theory works.
People take into account that interactions may be caused by different forces
and therefore should be described in different ways. It can be
either strong, weak or electromagnetic interaction. It depends
on the type of particle being scattered and the target which reaction it is.

In order to proper describe the nuclear reactions many
components should be taken into account.
First of all, different forces may act on
the participants.


The strong nuclear force appear inside the nuclei and among others bound neutrons 
and protons together. The description of strong interactions is extremely
difficult as it deals not only with nucleon, but with their constituents: quarks
and gluons. Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD) is a modern theory
describing strong interactions, but it has also its limitations and, at the moment,
it is not useful at low energies ($Q^2 \lesssim 1 GeV^2$).
So other approaches are coming into the scene such as 
chiral effective theory, lattice calculation and others \cite{IOFFE2006232}.

Starting the study of three- (and more) nucleon systems it was found that 
strong 2N force is not enough to describe
the system and 3N force was introduced. The first applications of such
a force showed that it brings sufficient contribution and cannot be ignored \cite{GLOCKLE1982343}.
Whereas the first applications included only early "realistic" potential, the latter
investigations only proved this statements \cite{StoksPhysRevC49, WIRINGAPhysRevC51}.
It was also used to construct four-nucleon (4N) bound state \cite{NoggaPhysRevLett}.

Electromagnetic force appears between charged particles like protons, electrons or pions.
Also, the force is transferred between charged particles with a photon, so 
in photon- and electron- scatterings on the nuclei an electromagnetic
force is playing an important role. Arenh\"{o}vel \cite{ArenhovelPhotodisint1991} 
studied electromagnetic process - deuteron photodisintegration,
applying different approaches and comparing the results with
experimental data.

The weak force...

\subsection*{Nuclear forces used in the thesis}

In order to construct a potential people often use phenomenological
or semi-phenomenological approaches. It allows to combine
theoretical knowledge about processes and experimental data.

One of such potentials, which was used in current thesis is Argonne V18 (AV18) \cite{AV18Wiringa} 
In order to construct NN force, authors combine
analytical electromagnetic and one-pion-exchange parts
with phenomenological one, fitting parameters to
the Nijmegen partial-wave analysis of $pp$ and $np$ data \cite{NijmegenPhysRevC.48.792}. 
Authors showed, that AV18 potential delivers good results
in the description of nucleon scattering data as well as deuteron 
properties. 


In the early 1990-ies Weinberg \cite{WEINBERG1990,WEINBERG1991} introduced 
an idea of using a most general Lagrangian
satisfying assumed symmetry principles and in particular
spontaneously broken chiral symmetry to 
describe nuclear interactions at low energies.
This idea together with \gls*{eft} of \gls*{qcd} 
led to the development of the \gls*{ceft}
% a Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT)
which nowadays has become one of the most advanced approach to
describing nuclear reactions at low energies.
 
For the \gls*{eft} it is very important to 
define a quantity, which powers will determine a perturbation order.
In the \gls*{ceft} there are two natural scales: so-called soft scale -
the mass of Pion $Q \sim M_\pi$ and hard scale -
$\Lambda_\chi \sim 1~GeV$ (chiral symmetry breaking scale).
The ratio between these two scales $(Q/\Lambda_\chi)^\nu$
is being used as an expansion parameter in  \gls*{ceft} with power
$\nu$.

Considering so-called irreducible (the diagrams that cannot be split
by cutting nucleon lines), Weinberg \cite{WEINBERG1990,WEINBERG1991}
came to the identity for the powers of such diagrams

\begin{equation}
    \nu_W = 4 - A - 2C + 2L + \sum_i \Delta_i,
    \label{powers}
\end{equation}
where

\begin{equation}
    \Delta_i \equiv d_i + \frac{n_i}{2} - 2
    \label{Delta}
\end{equation}

In \eq{powers}, $C$ is a number of pieces which are connected, $L$ - the number of loops in the graph.
In \eq{Delta}, $n_i$ is a number of nucleon field operators, $d_i$ - the number of insertions
(or derivatives) of  $M_\pi$.

The further analysis of \eq{powers} revealed some problems which occur 
for particular values of parameters in the equation, namely negative values of $\nu_W$ 
are possible.
In order to deal with that, \eq{powers} 
was slightly modified adding $3A - 6$ to it  \cite{Machleidt2011, EPELBAUM2006_PROGRESS}:

\begin{equation}
    \nu = \nu_W + 3A  - 6 = -2 + 2A - 2C + 2L + \sum_i \Delta_i
    \label{powers_corrected}
\end{equation}


In \gls*{ceft} the first order is called "leading order" (LO, $\nu=0$)  and it is followed 
by next-to-leading order (NLO, $\nu=2$)
\footnote{The $\nu=1$ order is completely vanished due to parity and time-reversal invariance,
so next-to-leading order stands for the second order of expansion.},
 next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO, $\nu=3$) and so on.
 At each chiral order, particular interaction diagrams are described.
 At LO there is a diagram which consists of 2 contact terms and the diagram
 implying one-pion exchange. Both diagrams reflect only 2NF as well
 as diagrams at NLO, where more contact terms are introduced together with two-pion 
 exchange diagrams. Each subsequent order includes more and more sophisticated diagrams
 describing nucleons interaction,
 3NF appears at N$^2$LO while 4NF contributions are firstly described at N$^3$LO.
 So there is a systematic
way to include all the forces from simplest diagrams at LO and gradually
adding more and more terms. 
It is also beneficial in the way that 
one can obtain results using chiral potential at different
orders and track which one gives larger or smaller contribution (changes in the
final results).
The highest order for which there is a derived term in potential
is N$^4$LO at the moment. Nevertheless leading F-wave contact interactions from N$^5$LO are included in the N$^4$LO+ potential,
which is regarded as a best possible potential within my work. 

There are a number of another approaches within \gls*{ceft} utilized.
The group of Piarulli is using quit similar approach, including
the same chiral potentials with minor differences \cite{Piarulli2012,Piarulli2015}.

The \gls*{ceft} may be applied both in coordinate and momentum spaces.
Nevertheless in both cases it requires regularization which is cutting 
low coordinate values in order to avoid infinities 
(or high momentum values - in momentum space). 
The SMS potential is being regularized using the Gaussian form factor
$F(\vec{l}^2)$:

\begin{equation}
    F(\vec{l}^2) = e^{-\frac{\vec{l}^2 + M_\pi^2}{\Lambda^2}},
    \label{regulator}
\end{equation}
where $M_\pi$ is an effective pion mass and $\Lambda$ - is a cutoff parameter.

The form factor from \eq{regulator}, being used together with Feynman propagator,
ensures that long-range part of the forces has no singularities. 

The value at which
the cut is applied (cut-off value) is not fixed and usually calculations
are being performed for different cut-off values. The comparison
of such results may reveal stronger or weaker dependance and in perfect
case one will come up with such a potential, were the cut will
not affect results much. On the Fif.~\ref{potential_cutoff} 
I show values of the 2N potential $\matrixel{\vec{p}}{V}{\pvec{p}}$
as a function on the momentum $|\vec{p}|$ with fixed value $|\pvec{p}|$=0.054[fm].

    value of the momentum $p'$=1.798 [fm?].
    }
    \label{potential_cutoff}
\end{figure}



The potential may be transformed from coordinate to momentum space (or vice versa),
but it is important at which frame the regularization was performed
and what was a regularization function. That's why there are different 
versions of chiral potential. One is semi-local coordinate space regularized potential (SCS) \cite{Epelbaum2014SCS}
and another one is similar, but with regularization applied in momentum space (SMS potential) \cite{reinkrebs2018}.
