\section{Historical overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Weinberg \cite{WEINBERG1990}\\
        First application of method based on the chiral symmetry
        to derive an expansion of the potential. The most general Lagrangian
        consistent with spontaneous broken chiral symmetry and other symmetries.
        That Lagrangian envolved pions and low-energy nucleons. 
    \item Epelbaum ???
    \item the newest chiral force \cite{reinkrebs2018} 
    \item Arenhovel \cite{ArenhovelPhotodisint1991}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What he did?
        \item Why Deuteron photodisintegration study is important
        \item Approaches
