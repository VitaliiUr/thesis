% \section{Historical overview}
        
In the second half of XX century physical society faced
a problem of describing low-energetic nuclear reactions.
\gls*{qcd} is hardly applicable here as it is nonperturbative 
at low energies what complicates a lot search for the solutions \cite{Machleidt2011}. 

In the early 1990-ies Weinberg \cite{WEINBERG1990,WEINBERG1991} introduced 
an idea of using a most general Lagrangian
satisfying assumed symmetry principles and in particular
spontaneously broken chiral symmetry to 
describe nuclear interactions at low energies.
This idea together with \gls*{eft} of \gls*{qcd} 
led to the development of \gls*{ceft}
% a Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT)
which nowadays has become one of the most advanced approach to
describing nuclear reactions at low energies.
 
For the \gls*{eft} it is very important to 
define a quantity, which powers will determine a perturbation order.
In the \gls*{ceft} there are two natural scales: so-called soft scale -
the mass of Pion $Q \sim M_\pi$ and hard scale -
$\Lambda_\chi \sim 1~GeV$ (chiral symmetry breaking scale).
The ratio between these two scales $(Q/\Lambda_\chi)^\nu$
is being used as an expansion parameter in  \gls*{ceft} with power
$\nu$.

Considering so-called irreducible (the diagrams that cannot be split
by cutting nucleon lines), Weinberg \cite{WEINBERG1990,WEINBERG1991}
came to the identity for the powers of such diagrams\cite{Machleidt2011}:

\begin{equation}
    \nu_W = 4 - A - 2C + 2L + \sum_i \Delta_i,
    \label{powers}
\end{equation}
where

\begin{equation}
    \Delta_i \equiv d_i + \frac{n_i}{2} - 2
    \label{Delta}
\end{equation}

In \ref*{powers}, $C$ is a number of pieces which are connected, $L$ - the number of loops in the graph.
In \ref*{Delta}, $n_i$ is a number of nucleon field operators, $d_i$ - the number of insertions
(or derivatives) of  $M_\pi$.

\subsection*{Why we study few nucleon systems}

The study of light nuclei for the decades has been serving as an easiest way
to study NN systems and forces inside the atom. And
convenient way to proceed may be an interaction of atom with
other particles: elastic or inelastic scattering.
It is possible to construct such an experiments and check if theory works.
People take into account that interactions may be caused by different forces
and therefore should be described in different ways. It can be
either strong, weak or electromagnetic interaction. It depends
on the type of particle being scattered and the target which reaction it is.



The strong nuclear force appear inside the nuclei and among others bound neutrons 
and protons together. The description of strong interactions is extremely
difficult as it deals not only with nucleon, but with their constituents: quarks
and gluons. Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD) is a modern theory
describing strong interactions, but it has also its difficulties
as it is not reliable at low energies ($Q^2 \lesssim 1 GeV^2$) \cite{IOFFE2006232}.

...  

Starting the study of 3- (and more) nucleon systems it was found that 2N force is not enough to describe
the system and 3N force was introduced. The first applications of such
a force showed that it brings sufficient contribution and cannot be ignored \cite{GLOCKLE1982343}.
Whereas the first applications included only early "realistic" potential, the latter
investigations only proved this statements \cite{StoksPhysRevC49, WIRINGAPhysRevC51}.
It was also used to construct four-nucleon (4N) bound state \cite{NoggaPhysRevLett}.
